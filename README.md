1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Title
Customer Churn Analysis using Python
2Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.
The goal is to identify key factors influencing churn and build a predictive model.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Information
The dataset contains customer demographic, service usage, and churn status details.
Features include:
CustomerID ‚Äì Unique ID of customers
Tenure ‚Äì Duration customer has stayed with the company
MonthlyCharges ‚Äì Customer's monthly bill
TotalCharges ‚Äì Total money spent
Contract Type ‚Äì Type of contract (Month-to-Month, One year, Two years)
Churn ‚Äì (Target Variable: Yes/No)
4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values in TotalCharges column.
Converted categorical variables (Contract, PaymentMethod) into numerical form using one-hot encoding.
Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üìä
Used Matplotlib & Seaborn to analyze churn trends:
Higher churn rate for Month-to-Month contracts.
Customers with higher MonthlyCharges tend to churn more.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building & Evaluation ü§ñ
Machine Learning Models Used:
‚úÖ Logistic Regression
‚úÖ Random Forest Classifier
‚úÖ XGBoost
Best model: Random Forest with 85% accuracy.
7Ô∏è‚É£ Key Insights & Business Recommendations
Offer discounts or loyalty programs for Month-to-Month users.
Improve customer engagement for users with high MonthlyCharges.
Provide incentives for long-term contracts.
